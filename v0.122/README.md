# v0.122
This folder contains the non-published updates I made to the site to get it (and the theme) working with Hugo 0.122.

I decided to move to Mkdocs Material at this point instead, hence the changes were never published.

It contains a copy of the hello-friend-ng theme under the `themes` folder instead of the git submodule for preservation reasons.

A fully built copy of the site is also under the public folder, through I don't remember if the changes I made to the setup to get it working were finished before I made the choice to pivot to Mkdocs ðŸ˜…

I'm mostly just keeping this here for preservation reasons.
