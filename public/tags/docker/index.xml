      <description>What is Kafka? Essentially:
 Kafka is an open-source, very scalable, distributed messaging platform by Apache. It is designed to handle large volumes of data in real-time efficiently.
 Kafka works on the concept of a &amp;ldquo;publish-subscribe&amp;rdquo; methodology:
 &amp;ldquo;Producers&amp;rdquo; will push content to the Kafka cluster, to a destination &amp;ldquo;topic&amp;rdquo;. A Kafka cluster is managed by Zookeeper, and can contain one or more &amp;ldquo;Brokers&amp;rdquo;. Brokers manage topics and the associated ingress and egress messages.</description>

      <description>Introduction I recently completed a deployment inside a customer&amp;rsquo;s lab involving several containerized services, in which the server instances provided were not permitted to have direct access to the internet. To add to the issue, the instances themselves were running RHEL 7.3 with no active subscription.
There were several problems in play here:
 Docker only make their Enterprise Edition (EE) compatible with RHEL. The usual free Community Edition (CE) is not officially supported.</description>
